<p>I am an avid gamer.</p>
<p>I have been playing games since the age of five. My first console was the Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>I now use a PC. It's my favorite part of the day to come home relax and play with friends.</p>

<p>When I'm not gaming I invest some of my time into movies or tv shows.</p>
<p>I absolutely love story-telling. This makes me a bit of a movie critic when it comes to films.</p>
<p>Although nothing beats eating food (such as pizza or popcorn w/ cheese) and watching a film with friends and family or even by yourself.</p>

<p>On a more productive day I enjoy learning and playing with code.</p>
<p>I enjoy typing on a computer and expressing myself creativly.</p>
<p>Coding can definately prove difficult to understand, but rewarding when you've succesfully finish a project.</p>

<p>Writing is also a favorite of mine, especially writing on a computer.</p>
<p>As stated previously I enjoy typing, story-telling, and expressing myself creativly and writing fullfills all of those pleasures for me.</p>
<p>I love bringing my imagination to life and who knows maybe one day I will write my very own novel!</p>
