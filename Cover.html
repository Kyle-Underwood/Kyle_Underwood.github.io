<h3><i>My Intended Major</i></h3>
<ol>
<li><i>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</i></li>
<li><i>2025 Expected Graduation</i></li>
</ol>
<h3><i>Experience Summary</i></h3>
<pre><i>My experiances involve delivery skillsets, sales and customer handling, and coding experiances.
I've been a delivery driver for 4 years. This built the foundation of my navigation skills. This also 
influenced my customer support skills; making sure orders were correct and how to handle incorrect orders.
I've also been gaining certifications from w3schools and freecodecamp and additionally cs50 for code 
certifications.

<h3><i>My Preceived Calling</i></h3>
<pre><i>I believe God is leading to much more than just a Software Engineer. I believe God is also 
leading me into ministry. God is shaking up my world and remolding me (in the best way possible). 
Not only am I expanding my knowledge on coding and software development, I am also diving into 
the word of God. Me and my dad will be involved in setting up Alpha courses to reach those
in question of God's goodness.
